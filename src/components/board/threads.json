The same thing that you&apos;ll most likely expect in a discussion with one of yesterday who has a contrasting or conventional view of visual style. But take their experience with you and decide whether to adopt or do something completely different! Go and meet the people! Expect experienced or even skilled people from whom you can learn and with whom you can argue. Also expect the total bollocks. Make your own judgement. I also may be an old bag by your standards yet I spend a lot of time here giving my best advice and knowledge.<br><br>I can tell you about my experiences that may or may not apply to your locals. I visit a group of very experienced analog photographers. They are mainly autodidacts and technically amateurish through analogue networking, image processing programs are not intuitive for the most of them. Today, a lot of technical knowledge can be better and easier experienced and read on the internet. Maybe that&apos;s why I&apos;m still rebellious, thinking that I can do things better or in another way, that I have a very technical knowledge and a drive and thirst for knowledge that many people there don&apos;t have anymore. So I&apos;m a smart-ass who&apos;s read about everything and also tried a lot of things. But when it comes to successful photos I&apos;m very far behind them. I can swim along very well, but I don&apos;t manage, compared to others there, to constantly convince with very good results."

Since his childhood, a photographer of this group has portrayed all the craftsmen and people in the area in their everyday activities. Today he looks back on a life&apos;s work with truly wonderful portraits showing contemporary life. Some people did exactly the same, but with a bit of luck and therefore fame. The local is now more famous than ever, but has never been known outside this area. In my opinion, he deserves much more attention and praise."

Modern electronic mirrorless lens mount for Micro Four Thirds system cameras.<br><br>* Four Thirds. Modern electronic SLR lens mount for Four Thirds system cameras. They have the same sensor size as micro Four Thirds, but they&apos;re SLRs, so they have a mirror box and associated longer flange-focal distance. You can mount Four Thirds lenses on a Micro Four Thirds camera with an adapter.<br><br>* m42. Old manual-focus lens system for film SLRs. This has been obsolete forever, but it was such a simple and once-ubiquitous system that a lot of camera makers used it, so there&apos;s a lot of old m42 lenses out there. Plus, they&apos;re easy to adapt on just about every modern camera system except for Nikon SLRs because Nikon had to be a fussy baby when they made the F mount. It&apos;s called m42 based on the size of the screw threads (or the diameter of the mount? Something like that). You can easily mount an m42 lens on a Micro Four Thirds camera with an adapter, but despite the fact that one&apos;s called m42 and the other is often called m43 and they&apos;re both, you know, lens mounts, they don&apos;t really have anything in common."

The focusing discrepancy is purely because of many 43 lenses being designed to use PDAF, which only the EM1 has. On the EM1.2 and EM1x, focusing perfomance of most 43 lenses, especially the SHG lenses, is reportedly better than even on the E series bodies.<br><br>I&apos;d say 43 lenses can definitely be considered native, at least on Olympus flagship bodies with PDAF. Even then, most 43 lenses focus just fine with CDAF only, and the performance hit isn&apos;t as extreme as you think. When you compare the focusing speed of 43 lenses on m43, they still outperform most native lenses on other mounts from the same era."
